Predicting Diabetes among PIMA population

## Overview:
Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, affects over 29 million people in the United States. Diabetes arises due to improper production and/or functioning of the hormone insulin, resulting in impaired metabolism of carbohydrates leading to a high level of glucose in the blood. Molecular mechanism of diabetes and its adverse impact on the body is well documented with animations in the following video. 

Pima Indians living in Arizona have the highest rate of obesity and diabetes ever recorded. Thus, I will be using data collected from Pima Indians to predict diabetes with machine learning.
